#### Deliverables:
1. Write down all needed high level scenarios( minimum 10 scenarios) to ensure good coverage with different approaches
   ( confirming requirements, negative scenarios). These High level scenarios should contain all details needed to cover this.
2. Write with the scenarios' prioritization of such test cases according to their possible business impact.

### B- Bug Reporting

#### Deliverables:
1. Write down bugs you found with detailed reports (minimum 6 bugs to be found).
2. Mention(Title,ReproducibleSteps,Attachments,AffectedDevices,Network,Severity,Priority,Impact)
3. Make sure to vary in the types of the bugs found as QA Engineers donâ€™t only work with developers, but also closely
   collaborate with Product Managers.It would be great if you have a strong product sense, you're welcome to spot any
   UX issues in this app and write it down.

### C- Test Automation

#### Deliverables:
1. Document Several detailed Test Cases to ensure good coverage by automation.
2. Implement automated tests based on the test cases from the previous step.

> list of automated test cases for Google search page:
1. validate google logo exists 
2. validate search bar exists
3. validate write and clear text in search bar
4. validate that suggestions list appears after enter text in search bar
5. validate search for a special keyword and expecting a result to appear first ex. instabug
6. validate search using empty keywords' ex. (add single or multiple spaces then click search)
7. validate that pagination exists at the end of page in case of many results
8. validate that pagination is working 
9. validate search status (time and number of results)
10. search using multiple inputs with different criteria using a data provider ex.(very long input, special chars, meaningless keywords, numbers only)
